### Explanation of Key Variables:

- **Country**: This variable helps identify the geographic region for each observation. It is crucial for country-level comparisons and understanding regional trends in employment.

- **Total Weekly Hours Worked**: Indicates the total number of hours worked by the population across various sectors. This is a key measure for analyzing the general impact of the pandemic on work hours.

- **Percentage of Working Hours Lost**: This percentage represents how much of the total working time was lost, which directly correlates with the economic impact of COVID-19 on employment.

- **Percent Hours Lost (40hrs per week)** and **Percent Hours Lost (48hrs per week)**: These variables allow for a more granular analysis, showing how different work-hour expectations (40 vs. 48 hours) are affected by the pandemic.

- **Labour Dependency Ratio**: Important for understanding the burden of dependency on the employed population. It can help inform policies related to labor market recovery.

- **Employed Female/Male 25+ (2019)**: These two variables allow for gender-based comparisons, assessing how employment rates for males and females aged 25 and above were impacted during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019.

- **Ratio of Weekly Hours Worked by Population Aged 15-64**: This variable is essential to understanding labor force participation among the working-age population (15-64 years). It's useful for identifying changes in employment behavior due to COVID-19.
